# Produce Interactive Visualization Project
## Description
As a college student, finding affordable produce can be a challenging task. This project creates an interactive dashboard that allows users to view retail and farm prices over the last 20 years for different produce. It also attempts to discover key underlying trends such as the seasonality of produce and variations in produce costs and spreads across four major cities. 
By understanding the dynamics of price fluctuations, college students, farmers, and retailers alike gain an understanding of the historical change in various produce prices.

The following data science concepts are used in this project

1. Data loading from a csv
2. Data cleaning (Outlier removal, dealing with null values, making data numeric)
3. EDA (Understand statistical distribution)
4. Feature Engineering (Make data more suitable for solving the problem)
5. Visualization (Create a user-friendly dashboard for seamless access to produce pricing information.)

The following technology & libraries are used in this project

1. Google Colab
2. Python
3. Pandas & Numpy (Data reading & cleaning)
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn (Static Visualization)
5. Plotly (Interactive Visualization)

### Future Improvements
In future projects, I aim to enhance the accuracy of these insights by refining the outlier removal techniques, as suggested by exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
Furthermore, I plan to take a step forward by incorporating predictive modeling based on the historical analysis, providing users with even more proactive and precise decision-making capabilities.
